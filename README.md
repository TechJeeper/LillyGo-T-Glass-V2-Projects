This is my repo of T-Glass V2 Arduino Sketches.

Dad Joke: Uses ChatGPT to generate a Dad Joke and output them either static or scrolling on your display.  Customizable speed and text in the variables within the sketch. 

Webserver Notification: Sets up a lightweight webserver on Port 80 that accepts messages and presents them on the display.  I use MacroDroid to send app notifications to the web server.  Pressing the button dismisses the message.   The MacroDroid .macro file is in the directory as well.
